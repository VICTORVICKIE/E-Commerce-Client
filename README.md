# Saravana Enterprise E-Commerce Web App

This project utilizes several modern tools and technologies to create a high-performance and feature-rich e-commerce web application. The front-end of the application is built using the SvelteKit web framework and styled using Tailwind CSS with the help of DaisyUI components.

To manage the application's data, the project makes use of the Prisma database toolkit and leverages the scalability and reliability of the Planetscale database-as-a-service platform. Additionally, the application's authentication logic is handled by Lucia, a minimalist svelte library that provides an easy-to-use auth.

Firebase is also used in this e-commerce web application for image hosting and push notification functionalities. The Firebase platform provides a reliable and efficient solution for image hosting, which allows the application to store and serve product images to users quickly and efficiently. Firebase's Cloud Messaging service is leveraged to provide push notification functionality, enabling the application to send targeted notifications to users.

By leveraging Vercel's serverless architecture, the application can dynamically scale its server resources to handle increased traffic and ensure that users always have a fast and reliable experience. By using Vite PWA, the application is able to provide users with a seamless experience across a wide range of devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. The result is an application that is more accessible, more responsive, and more user-friendly.

With these technologies and tools, this e-commerce web application is designed to be efficient, scalable, and user-friendly, providing an optimal user experience and high performance for both customers and merchants alike.
